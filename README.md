## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html       # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css       # All CSS styles (consolidated)

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or
3. Use a local server: `npx serve .`

## ✏️ Editing in Cursor

This capture is structured for easy editing:

- **HTML**: Edit `index.html` for structure and content
- **Styles**: All CSS is in `styles.css` for easy modification
- **Assets**: Images are referenced by URL (see `ASSETS.md`)

## 🔗 Combining Multiple Captures

To merge multiple captures:

1. Copy desired sections from each `index.html`
2. Merge relevant styles from each `styles.css`
3. Resolve any CSS conflicts by namespacing or specificity
4. Update image references as needed

## 📝 Notes

- This is a static snapshot of the original page
- External resources (images, fonts) are referenced by URL
- JavaScript functionality is preserved from the original page
- Some dynamic content may not work without the original backend
- **API keys and secrets have been removed for security**

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- Add `class` attributes to elements for easier styling
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Consider converting inline styles to CSS classes
- Replace remote images with local copies for full offline support
